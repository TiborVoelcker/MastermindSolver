        The algorithm goes through all possible guesses. For each guess, it
        generates all possible responses and the still remaining possible
        codes. Then, for the still remaining possible codes, a new guess is
        found, and so on, up to a maximum depth. The maximum depth is then
        increased per run, until a chain of guesses is found, where only one
        possible code remains, independent of the received responses.

        This means that this algorithm is very conservative. But the
        worst-case scenario should be better than with Knuth's algorithm.

        This recursive algorithm uses heavy memoization to speed up the
