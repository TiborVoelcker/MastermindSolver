# MastermindSolver
Solver for the board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

It uses Donald E. Knuth's [worst-case method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Worst_case:_Five-guess_algorithm). The next move is chosen by analysing the minimum possible eliminations for this guess (a.k.a the maximum eliminations in the worst-case).
